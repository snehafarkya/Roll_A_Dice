### <u> ***About the Game :*** </u>

<mark style="background: purple; color:white;padding:3px">Remember playing a rolling dice game in childhood? </mark> 
     We've all loved it when dice throws 6 because of the extra chance it gives!
     This game is all about remincing your childhood memories. This is made with python.

   <code>1. You have to roll a dice. 
      2. Whatever number comes in, an associated task will be given to you. 
      3. You have to perform the task. 
      4. After you're done, press enter.

A <code style="background:skyblue;">Random</code> module is used here to choose a random number in the range og 1 to 6.  
Basically it will ask you your name. If you agree to play, press 1. Then, it wll randomly gives you a number and you have to perform the associated task! 
Meanwhile, if you press 2, you will exit from the game as the <code style="background:skyblue;">exit()</code> function comes into play. 

### <u> ***Connectivity with MySQL :*** </u> 

The most researching part of this game is <mark>How to connect MySQL database with Python.</mark> 
After googling it for almost 10 times, I finally found my answerðŸ¤©. 
Here is the code snippet: 

<code>import mysql.connector 
    mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user= "root",
        passwd= "yourpassword",
        database = "roll_a_dice_python"
)
mycursor = mydb.cursor()</code>
